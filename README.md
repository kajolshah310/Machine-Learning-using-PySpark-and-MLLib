# Machine-Learning-using-PySpark-and-MLLib
Implemented machine learning models for big data using Apache Spark and MLLib


In this project, I have worked on a car dataset extracted from AutoDealerData.com and available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cisautomotiveapi/large-car-dataset containing many different features which are important and play an important role while buying/selling cars. We have visualized various parameters of this dataset to get a better understanding of the data and have built machine learning models using Apache Spark and MLLib to predict the outcomes.

Our aim here is to find the MSRP of the cars based on the different features.
