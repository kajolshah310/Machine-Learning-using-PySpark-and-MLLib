# Machine Learning using PySpark and MLLib

![PySpark Logo](pyspark_logo.png)

## Description
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements machine learning models for big data using Apache Spark and MLLib. The project focuses on working with a car dataset extracted from AutoDealerData.com, which is available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cisautomotiveapi/large-car-dataset). The dataset consists of various features that are important for buying/selling cars. The main objective of this project is to predict the MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price) of the cars based on these features.

The notebook showcases the following:
- Data visualization and exploration to gain insights into the car dataset
- Preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, feature selection, and encoding categorical variables
- Building machine learning models using PySpark and MLLib
- Evaluating the performance of the models using appropriate metrics

## Features
- Implementation of machine learning models for big data using Apache Spark and MLLib
- Visualization and exploration of the car dataset
- Preprocessing techniques to handle missing values and categorical variables
- Multiple machine learning algorithms to predict car MSRP
- Evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics

## Requirements
To run the notebook and perform machine learning using PySpark and MLLib, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Apache Spark
- PySpark
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Pandas

Please ensure that you have Apache Spark and PySpark properly installed and configured on your system.

## Usage
1) Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/kajolshah310/Machine-Learning-using-PySpark-and-MLLib.git
```

2) Navigate to the repository's directory:
```
cd Machine-Learning-using-PySpark-and-MLLib/LargeCarDataSetBigDataProject-main/src
```
3) Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook
```

4) Open the ML_Algorithm_on_Full_Dataset.ipynb notebook and execute the cells to follow along with the implementation of machine learning models on the car dataset.
Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different machine learning algorithms and preprocessing techniques to improve the predictions.
