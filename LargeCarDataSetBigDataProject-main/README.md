WORKING WITH APACHE SPARK MLLIB

Problem statement:
Transportation services have become core community necessities for both daily activities and travel. The aim of our project is to predict the selling price of a car based on the given features by using Big Data Technologies. For this, we have applied different machine learning algorithms to our dataset by using Apache Spark and MLlib. We would like to estimate future pricing by applying one of the MLlib algorithms and providing visual outputs of price changes using Tableau software in the future.

Objective:

We aim to study the large car dataset of new and used car listings from dealers and get meaningful information using Apache Spark and ML libraries . Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
